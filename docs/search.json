    "text": "Between 2019 and 2060, the number of US adults aged 65 years or older will likely increase from 54 to 95 million; the oldest-old (85+ years) will grow from 6.6 to 19 million over the same period.1,2 These demographic shifts carry significant implications for the practice of anesthesiology. In 2007, the elderly (15% of the US population) underwent 35% of inpatient surgeries.3 In 2006, 32% of outpatient surgeries were performed in the elderly.4 Moreover, the risk of postoperative complications increases with age.5,6 Improving the quality of perioperative care for older adults is a major priority for patients, providers, and policy makers."

    "text": "1.5 Methods\n\n1.5.1 Search\nThe literature search will include publications from 2000 to present (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Central).\n\n\n1.5.2 Study inclusion/exclusion criteria\n\nStudies of geriatric patients. (Studies including younger patients will be considered if a result is judged transportable to the target population).\nPublication Types\n\nPublished journal articles, reports \nLanguage restrictions: English language only\nLimited to humans\nGrey literature\n\nStudy Designs\n\nInclude\n\nRandomized clinical trials\nNon-randomized trials\nQuasi-randomized designs (e.g., before-after studies, interrupted time series)\nCohort studies (prospective, retrospective)\nCase-control studies\nOther observational studies (e.g., diagnostic accuracy)\n\nExclude\n\nCase reports and case series\nSurveys, questionnaires\nLetters\nEditorials\nConference abstracts\nSystematic reviews and meta-analyses (for reference checking)\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.3 Search Strategies\n(Separate document)\n\n\n1.5.4 Data Abstraction and Management\nTitle/abstract and full-text screening together with data extraction will be performed on the DistillerSR platform.7 All screening will be conducted in duplicate, with disagreements resolved by consensus or a third reviewer as needed.\nAnticipated data extraction includes study characteristics (e.g., design, dates, setting, centers, country, funding, registration, subgroups, surgery, and anesthetic), study arms (e.g., intervention, participant characteristics, intervention, and outcomes reported), and outcome detail according to type (e.g., patient-reported or clinical; continuous, dichotomous [includes relative effects], rating scales [Likert, visual analog, numeric]). As required, figures will be digitized. A single reviewer will extract study data followed by verification.8\n\n\n1.5.5 Risk of Bias of Individual Studies\nRisk of bias assessment for randomized trials will be conducted using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. 9 Risk of bias assessment of non-randomized studies of interventions (e.g., observational studies of interventions including cohort, case-control, and quasi-randomized designs) will utilize the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions tool (ROBINS-I).10 Risk of bias will be assessed independently by two reviewers with discrepancies resolved by discussion, or a third reviewer as needed.\n\n\n1.5.6 Evidence Synthesis\nAs appropriate, based on clinical and methodological heterogeneity, study results will be pooled in either pairwise or network meta-analyses in random effects models (given the goal of estimating unconditional effects not relevant only to the pooled studies).11 Statistical heterogeneity is evaluated using between study variance and I2.12 When there is meaningful heterogeneity and the number of studies sufficient (e.g., 10 or more) meta-regression is considered to explain the variability.13 With 10 or more pooled studies, small study effects and the potential for publication bias will be examined in funnel plots, regression-based tests, adjustment methods, and p-curves.14,15\nRelative effects will be pooled as risk ratios for clinical interpretability except when adjusted measures reported as odds are pooled. Continuous measures are pooled as mean differences or standardized mean differences when studies use differing scales. When practicably, standardized mean differences will be re-expressed on the most meaningful scale.16 R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) will be used for analyses and data made publicly available when the guideline is completed.\n\n\n1.5.7 Grading the Strength of Evidence\nThe strength (certainty) of evidence for important outcomes will be appraised using either GRADE17 and ACCF/AHA18 frameworks.\n\n\n1.5.8 Registration\nTBD\nTable. Protocol Development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nSection\nModification\n\n\n\n\nJuly 2021\n\nFirst draft\n\n\nJune 2022\nKey questions\nKey questions removed: EEG monitoring and cognitive function; sedation titration with EEG monitoring; and maintaining intraoperative high blood pressure"
